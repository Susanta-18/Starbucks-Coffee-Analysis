The Most Nutritious / Healthiest cup of coffee is not the same for everyone.

Determining the healthiest cup of coffee for you depends on your health goals. If you’re trying to lose weight, you should opt for low-calorie or calorie-free beverages.
If you’re sensitive to caffeine or have anxiety or a heart condition, you might need to switch to decaf coffee.
If you have diabetes, you’ll want to reduce the amount of sugar you add to your brew.

Health experts agree that adding loads of sweeteners to your coffee or overindulging in caffeinated beverages is bad for your health. Benefits and risks depend on moderation.

What makes coffee more or less healthy?

Many factors affect the healthfulness of your coffee. The caffeine among coffee’s biggest health concerns. Other things that play a role in coffee’s health quality include:

- Added sweeteners
- Added milk or cream
- Antioxidant content
- Brewing method

In the end, an unsweetened cup of medium roast Brewed Black Coffee / Espresso is probably the best.

Thank you!
